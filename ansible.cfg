# config file for ansible -- http://ansible.com/
# ==============================================

# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

[defaults]

# some basic default values...

inventory      = ./hosts
library        = ./library
roles_path     = ./roles
transport      = smart
module_lang    = C
remote_user    = root
gathering      = explicit
remote_tmp     = /tmp/ansible/


[ssh_connection]
# By default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with
# sudoers configurations that have requiretty (the default on many distros).
#
pipelining = True

# if True, make ansible use scp if the connection type is ssh
# (default is sftp)
scp_if_ssh = True
